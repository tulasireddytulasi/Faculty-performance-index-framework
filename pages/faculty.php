              The aim of India’s higher education system is attaining sustainable development and achieving higher growth rates which could be enabled through creation, transmission and dissemination of knowledge. Higher education at all levels in the country is witnessing a consistent growth pattern marked by the setting up of new institutions and the improvement of the existing ones. Demand for qualified teachers and faculty members over the next few years would be substantial and will become extremely critical for states to expand the current institutional capacities, not only of infrastructure but also of qualified and trained faculty members.

              Increasing internationalization in teaching is strongly supported by the Indian education sector and is considered vital for Indian institutions in developing India’s capacity in research and innovation, driving up India’s institutional ranking and increasing the quality of teaching and learning. Thus, enhancing the academic and intellectual environment in the institutions by providing faculty members with ample opportunities to pursue research and also to participate in seminars / conferences / workshops has become vital for developing nations like India. Participation in such programmes would enable faculty members to update their research and pedagogical skills.
